This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system applied to Civil Law, specifically focusing on Inheritance and Divorce in Italy, Estonia, and Slovenia.

The goal is to compare two architectural strategies for handling a multinational legal dataset.

🏗 ## **Architectures implemented**
We explore two main design patterns for routing queries across different jurisdictions:

1. Task A: Single-Agent (ReAct)

A unified agent that uses ReAct-style logic.

Routing: The model explicitly decides if retrieval is needed and which specific sub-corpus (e.g., "Italian Divorce" vs. "Estonian Inheritance") to query.

Process: Thought → Action (Vector Search) → Observation → Answer .

2. Task B: Multi-Agent (Supervisor)

A hierarchical system with a Supervising Agent.

Routing: The supervisor classifies the user intent and routes the query to specialized sub-agents.

Aggregation: Specialized agents retrieve data from their specific vector stores; the supervisor merges their outputs into a final coherent answer.


📂 ## **Dataset**
The system operates on a dataset provided in JSON format, covering:

Countries: Italy, Estonia, Slovenia.

Content Types:

Inheritance Civil Codes.

Divorce Civil Codes.

Past Legal Cases (rulings and outcomes).

📊 ## **Evaluation**
Performance is evaluated using the RAGAS framework. The dashboard tracks:

Context Precision & Recall.

Faithfulness (grounding in documents).

Answer Correctness vs. ground truth.
